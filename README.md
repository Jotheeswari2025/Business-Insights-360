# Business_Insights_360_Project in Power BI
  I recently completed Business Insights 360 Project as part of my DA bootcamp from codebasics. It provides insight across Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Executive view which helps business leaders,      stakeholders to make data driven decisions

# Project Statement:
  AtliQ hardwares is a hardware manufacturing and selling company. 
  It sells its product to 
  Retailers   --> Brick & motor stores like croma, best buy; e-commerce stores like amazon, flipkart;
  Direct      --> AtliQ has its own stores like AtliQ Hardware e-store; AtliQ exclusive which sells products directly to consumers;
  Distributors--> AtliQ sells its products to different distributors due to some government regulations to sells its products in various countries.

  AtliQ hardware has become one of the rapidly growing company in electronics goods, as they grew they face loss in USA, they tried to establish their presence by opening their own stores and they experienced huge  loss, this happened because they made decisions based on some surveys they conducted and their own intuitions. AtliQ leadership and stakeholders decided to incorporate data analytics team and make data driven   decision making.


# Project Objective: 
  AtliQ hardware as of now maintaining their business data in Excel files and there are so many excel files. So, it is hard to consolidate and not effective in generating insights. They asked data analytics team to provide data transparency to make accurate decisions and provide business insights 360 across Finance view, Sales view, Marketing view, Supply chain view, Executive view

  Help AtliQ Hardwares leadership identify sales opportunities and underperforming regions in real-time.

  "Created dynamically changing titles by using switch function in DAX"
  "Designed visuals with slicers, drill-through, and conditional formatting"
  "Used DAX studio to reduce power bi file size upto 15% and optimized dashboard for better performance"
