# Business-Insights-360
I have created a Business Insights 360 view Project as part of my DA bootcamp from codebasics. It provides insight across Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, Executive view which helps business leaders, stakeholders to make data driven decisions

# Project Objective:
AtliQ Hardware is a Hardware manufacturing and selling company like PC, Mouse, Printers, etc. It sells their products to Direct, Retailer and Distributors. It became one of the fastest growing electronics goods sales company but unfortunately they face some issues for the past few years, they tried to establish a presence by opening their own stores but faced huge loss. This loss happened due to their poor decision making by taking surveys and their intuitions. The Business leaders planned to onboard data analytics team to make transperancey across their Products across countries and make data driven decisions.

# Project Statement: 
AtliQ hardware as of now maintaining their business data in Excel files and there are so many excel files. So, it is hard to consolidate and not effective in generating insights. They asked data analytics team to provide data transparency to make accurate decisions and provide business insights 360 across Finance view, Sales view, Marketing view, Supply chain view, Executive view

# Data Analytics Tools used:
